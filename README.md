# Betsy-Player
Betsy is the complex version of Connect4 game.  
Betsy player is the AI based agent which plays Betsy game.
It is implemented using Python programming language and works on some unique ideas on the top of expecti-minimax algorithm. 
It search for the better outcomes up to the depth of 15 levels in span of few seconds and returns the best suggestion. 
Through the thorough testing, I figured out that it will be very difficult to beat this Betsy player for any intermediate level human player.

Please check out the problem statement to undersand the structure and rules of the game. For check out the report file, it will provide 
important aspects of all functions and approaches i used to design the working pattern of the AI agent. In the last check out the source code 
for understanding the implementation of the ideas.
